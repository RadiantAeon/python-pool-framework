## Python Pool Framework
# A successor to yiimp
### THIS IS NOT COMPLETE
# Why does this exist?
I made this project after seeing yiimp fall into dissarray because tpruvot stopped contributing and no one else bothered contributing to the official branch and only worked on their private forks. I propose a new mining pool framework that is truly open source and also easier to setup and modify than the piece of php spaghetti code that yiimp was.

# Why should I contribute?
Every commit helps! Everything you do helps push this one step closer to production and helps the community to easily achieve the goal of decentralized mining with small, community pools, not monopolistic pools such as f2pool.
