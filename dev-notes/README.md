# Things that need to be done
- Complete all the stratum methods for btc.py (the basic template stratum server)
- ~~ Finish the tcp server for btc.py ~~
- Switch to redis (probably later in the future)
- Do tests on the hash checks of mining.submit in btc.py
- When adding a new module don't forget to change the uuid in the corresponding config file. The uuid can be generated by running `uuid.uuid4()` in python
- Hash all keys before sending to redis for speed.
- Add type checking for all input values
- The twisted factory/server setup is wrong and needs to be redone
